This is a Julia package registry for [PredictMD](https://predictmd.net)
and PredictMD-related packages.

# Usage

## Adding PredictMDRegistry

To add PredictMDRegistry, open Julia and run the following commands:

```julia
import Pkg; 
Pkg.Registry.add(Pkg.RegistrySpec(name="PredictMDRegistry",url="https://github.com/bcbi/PredictMDRegistry.git",uuid="26a550a3-39fe-4af4-af6d-e8814c2b6dd9",)); 
Pkg.Registry.update(Pkg.RegistrySpec(name="PredictMDRegistry",uuid="26a550a3-39fe-4af4-af6d-e8814c2b6dd9")); 
```

## Adding the General registry

Packages registered in PredictMDRegistry often have dependencies that are registered in the [General](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/General) registry (but are not registered in PredictMDRegistry). Therefore, you will probably want to make sure that you have also added the General registry. To add the General registry, open Julia and run the following commands:

```julia
import Pkg; 
Pkg.add("General"); 
Pkg.update("General"); 
```

## Updating registries

To update all of the registries that you have added, open Julia and run the following commands:
```julia
import Pkg; 
Pkg.update(); 
```

To update a specific registry, pass that registry as the argument to `Pkg.update`.

For example, to update PredictMDRegistry, open Julia and run the following commands:
```julia
import Pkg; 
Pkg.update("PredictMDRegistry"); 
```

As another example, to update the General registry, open Julia and run the following commands:
```julia
import Pkg; 
Pkg.update("General"); 
```
